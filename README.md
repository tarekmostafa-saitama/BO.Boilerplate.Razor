# BO.Boilerplate (Under Development)

BO.Boilerplate is an Angular and ASP.NET Core API project that serves as a starting point for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications. It incorporates various technologies and design patterns to help you kickstart your project development, including Clean Architecture, CQRS, JWT authentication, Repository pattern, Unit of Work, Multi-tenancy support, Hangfire for background jobs, Serilog for structured logging, Mailkit for email functionality, Healthchecks, caching (both in-memory and distributed), Trails Auditing, and Permission-Based Authorization.

## Technologies and Patterns

BO.Boilerplate is built using the following technologies and design patterns:

- **Angular**: A popular front-end framework for building modern web applications.
- **ASP.NET Core**: A versatile and cross-platform framework for building back-end APIs and web applications.
- **Clean Architecture**: A layered architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: A pattern that separates the read and write sides of an application, allowing for optimized query performance.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A secure and compact way of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that abstracts the data access layer, making it easier to switch data providers.
- **Unit of Work**: A pattern that helps manage database transactions and resource allocation.
- **Multi-tenancy (SaaS ready)**: Support for building multi-tenant applications, ideal for Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.
- **Hangfire**: A background processing framework for .NET applications.
- **Serilog**: A structured logging library for .NET applications.
- **Mailkit**: A library for sending and receiving email messages.
- **Healthchecks**: A built-in feature for monitoring the health of your application.
- **Caching (Memory & Distributed)**: Support for caching data in-memory and across distributed caches.
- **Trails Auditing**: Auditing and tracking changes to data.
- **Permission-Based Authorization**: A fine-grained authorization system based on user roles and permissions.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization with JWT tokens.
- Multi-tenancy support, making it Saas-ready.
- Background job processing using Hangfire.
- Structured logging with Serilog.
- Sending and receiving email with Mailkit.
- Healthchecks to monitor the application's health.
- Caching data in-memory and distributed caches.
- Trails auditing to track data changes.
- Fine-grained permission-based authorization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized using the Clean Architecture pattern, which consists of the following layers:

- **BO.Boilerplate.Application**: Contains application-specific logic and business rules.
- **BO.Boilerplate.Domain**: Defines the domain models and interfaces.
- **BO.Boilerplate.Infrastructure**: Implements data access, caching, and other infrastructure concerns.
- **BO.Boilerplate.API**: The API.
- **BO.Boilerplate.UI**: The Angular Project.
